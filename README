  This repository contains all necessary files to recreate my app and test
environment for course project on the topic "Hospital database designing. Drugs
supply subsystem".


  [ What is needed to recreate this project? ]

  To deploy testing environment:
    1) VirtualBox (version 6.1.30r148432 was used)
    2) Vagrant (version 2.2.19 was used)
    3) Ansible (version 2.12.1 was used)
    4) Python3.8 or newer (version 3.10 was used)

  To start the unbuilded application:
    1) Python3.8 or newer (version 3.10 was used)
    2) Python librares: Psycopg2 and PyQt5


  [ How to deploy testing environment? ]

  To deploy testing enviroment you need to enter the parameters specific to
your server in the "CPr/env/playbooks/hosts" file (needs only for dedic. server)
and to launch "deploy_db_srv_for_localhost.yml" or "deploy_db_srv_for_dedic.yml"
playbook (on depence where you need to deploy database server) in the
"CPr/env/playbooks/" directory by using the "ansible-playbook <playbook_name.yml>"
command. After you entering the command Ansible will creates a virtual machine
(only if the playbook for localhost deploying has been used), installs Postgresql
and prepares it for work. After that you can start application and do some tests.
That's all.

  NOTE: "deploy_db_for_dedic.yml" playbook also contains firewall's configuration
        commands. So if you don't want firewall configuration to be changed
        you need to delete or comment the responsible lines in the playbook.

  You can also choose half-automatic way to deploy the testing enviroment whithout
using Ansible, Vagrant, etc. All files that can help you for this way are
situated in the "CPr/HM_Deployment/" folder. The Deploy5.py script creates
database and fills it by data but it's requre some calibration and everything
else is up to you (choice what kind of host you will use to deploy the
database, roles creating, configs editing, etc). Good luck.


  [ How to start the application? ]

  Important: Before starting the unbuilded application at the first time
             you need to run "CPr/Application/recompileWindows.py" file.

  Execute the "CPr/Application/main.py" file to run unbuilded application.

  To launch builded application you need nothing. The builded executable file
of this application you can find at the "CPr/Application/dist" folder (it's
only for Linux at the moment).

  To connect to the database you need to enter IP and port of your DB server in the
last field instead of "localhost". It must be a string of the following format:
  192.168.56.12:2345

  NOTE: By default PostgreSQL server is configured to work with port 2345 (it is in
        the "CPr/env/playbooks/files/postgresql.conf") and to accept incoming
        connections from any adress (it is in "CPr/env/playbooks/files/pg_hba.conf")
